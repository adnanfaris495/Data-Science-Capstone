Falcon 9 Landing Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage rocket. SpaceX's cost-saving strategy relies on reusing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. The goal of this project is to analyze various factors that influence whether the first stage will land successfully. By accurately predicting the success of landings, we can provide valuable insights into SpaceXâ€™s landing operations.
